# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### NAME HERE

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
we need to set all negative prediction values to zero to be able to submit on kaggle

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
WeightedEnsemble_L3  

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
1- found date colume not on datetime type  
2- splite datetime to hour, day, month, and year for better performance 
3- found hight correlation between season vs month and temp vs atemp 
4- remove hilghy correlated columns season and atemp 

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
better performance by around 40% because we apply freatures engineering and this support the model performance 


## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
A slight improvement in the kaggle score after changing the hyper parameters.


### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
Will spend more time on hyperparameters tuning as we can build more efficient model.


### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|default|default|default|1.82318|
|add_features|default|default|default|0.46236|
|hpo|CAT(iterations),RF(n_estimators), XT(n_estimators)|GB(num_boost_round, num_leaves)|scheduler|0.47458|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

## Summary


1- Problem: Better utilization of the data generated by the systems in the bikesharing industry to expect the demand on our services.

2- Business Objective: Predict bike sharing demand provided data features.

3- Obtain Data: Data obtained from the "Bike Sharing Demand" kaggle competition.

4- apply initial model autogloun and get score on kaggle

5- Analyze Data and apply feature engineering on dataset

6- apply the autogloun model again on the new engineered feature and monitior the score on kaggle

7- Apply tuning hyperparameters on the Autogloun model and apply again with monitor the model performance
